Recently I found this website called **[Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/)**, which is really helpful when you want to add color(or say different theme) to your bootstrap project. There is also a [marketplace](https://wrapbootstrap.com/) for you to buy/sell themes.

I'll definetly try one next time I use bootstrap.
