I gave my iPad to my mom when I went back to China during the golden week, so I'm wondering if now is a good timing to buy a new iPad? Are they going to release a new model soon? "Buy or wait", that's the only options for me every time when I think about any product of Apple.

## Macrumors Buyers Guide

Then I found this [buyersguide](http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/) by Macrumors. I know Macrumors website for a long time and used to subscribe to their RSS feeds, but I never noticed they have a this website.

Here you can see each Apple model with red or yellow round buttons. I guess there'll be green ones once the "timing" is right to buy that product. As it says:

## When to Buy a New iPad

If you click the iPad link you'll see this:

You can see the last release was October 23, 2012. Average 
release cycles is 311 days so statistically there are still around 100 days left, but judging from the recent releases it could be next month! Recent rumors might be helpful, to at least give you something to fill in the blankness of waiting.

Maybe this time I'll give iPad mini a try.
