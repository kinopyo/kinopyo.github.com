I think I should be proud of myself to resist any alcohol in today's party. It's almost a month since I started this habit.

I never consider myself as a alcoholic, even though in certain sences I do want a beer. Like when meeting with friends, when exausted from work, when in friends' welcome/farewell/whatever party, when feel weak and lonely during the middle of the night. I thought it would be quite easy for me to stop drinking, but the reality told me I was too naive. I did feel the threaten and temptation. Alcohol is a very foundamental thing for socialization, as an adualt sometimes it's hard to say no. Especially like today, "All beers!", "Sorry please give me tea...".

But I survived, for whatever the reason I started it, I don't wanna give up, I'm gonna try my best to keep the records.
