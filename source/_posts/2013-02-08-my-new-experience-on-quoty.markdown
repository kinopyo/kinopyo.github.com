Recently I added photo uploading feature to [quoty.me](http://quoty.me), then yesterday after I watched a Chinese movie 一代宗师([The Grandmaster](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1462900/)) I uploaded some quotes with photos. It looks pretty good!

Here is a screenshot of it.

The movie is directed by 王家卫([Kar Wai Wong](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0939182/)), my favorite director, his movies are always full of deep, inspiring words. It's a movie, but taste like a novel. I'm so glad that I read Chinese so that I could fully enjoy the good work.

Another thing is, I was a little confused about how to make quoty, what it is, where it goes. But this experience, after watching a great movie then upload those quotes and photos, I can really recapture all the great moments in the movie, feels so good. Besides, be capable to improve the tool I'm using is another way to enjoy the life.
