## Off the topic
Sometimes when I find something in the internet that is really interesting and inspiring, normally I'd like to write a blog post about it, but then I may get lazy and just somehow give up or totally forget it. That's one thing I want to improve.

So from today I'm gonna try this "light weight" post, just share a link and perhaps plus one phrase of my comment. Sure it could be done in a tweet, but I just wanna keep it in my blog.

## The first step is to start
[The first step is to start by Jason Z. of 37signals](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2538-the-first-step-is-to-start)

> Many times the reasons we donâ€™t start something have nothing to do with lack of skills, materials, or facilities. The real blockers are self-criticism and excuses.

Totally non related to the quote above...but if you read the link you'll understand what am I talking about next..

When I was a child I used to draw a lot, I still remember an afternoon in Summer I just sit there and kept drawing for 5 hours, I was completely in the "flow", if I put it in the current popular terms, and totally forgot how could time pass so fast. I also organized an event to get my friends together in a weekend to draw together, at that time I was trying to draw my own manga story of Doraemon. But when passing into adolescence I didn't remember why but somehow I stopped drawing.

Oops that is more than "one phrase" =_=;;
