Just found out a theme called - [SOLARIZED](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).

And actually it supports a lot of Editors and terminals, just go to its website.

Now my iTerm looks like this:

I don't say it's fancy but if you're a little bit tired of default theme, you may want to try out something new. And changing themes or wallpapers regulary usually makes me feel better :)
