This week [Adobe Announced Source Code Pro](http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/09/source-code-pro.html), a open source font. I didn't try it until my friend recommend it to me.

Here is what it looks like, really amazing!

I'm using the `SourceCodePro-Light` font and [Nil Color theme for SublimeText](https://github.com/nilium/st2-nil-theme). They're perfect couples. Key point here is use that `Light` version instead of regular one.

The more I look at it, the more I like it. Look how beautiful the single quotation is!
