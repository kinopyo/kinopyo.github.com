## Peepcode video by Lars Pind

![](https://peepcode.com/system/uploads/2008/productivity-cover.jpg)

If you haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend you do it. It's totally worth 12$ at least for me.

[Peepcode - Productivity for Programmers](https://peepcode.com/products/productivity-for-programmers)

Here I share some quotes and notes I found useful.

## What is productivity?

> Productivity is a method for managing your time and your other resources. In other words, **it's managing yourself so you can achieve the most results in the least amount of time**. The way I measure that is not by the number of lines of code but rather by how quickly you achieve your end result.

This makes much sense.

## Notes I took
### Before
- Define your goal, outcome
- Write it down
- Be specific
- Regularly dump your Open Loops(Give yourself 15 mins, write down all the TODOs or anything that bothers you at that time. Then review it either tell yourself you're gonna do it or just let it go)

### During
- Avoid Distractions
- The 50/10 Rule(50 mins of focus, 10 mins break)
- Work with your energy, honor your energy, track your energy.

### After
- Get rest
- Get exercise
- Celebrate

## Off topic
### Find another boss

In the "After - Get rest" part Lars told us the tip to deal with your boss:

> Now I deserve to take some time off. If your boss doesn't agree, you should have a conversation with your boss about that. If he still doesn't agree, find another boss.

Maybe it's the easiest and most efficient way :)

### Emotional Design
In the video it mentioned about the book "[Emotional Design](http://www.amazon.com/Emotional-Design-Everyday-Things-ebook/dp/B005GKIYD4/)", I didnâ€™t remember when and where I heard this book before, I was very interested in this book long ago. (Maybe it was in the book [Drive](httmarp://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-Motivates-ebook/dp/B004P1JDJO/)?). So after I ran into it this time, I 1-clicked on Amazon without hesitation ^^
