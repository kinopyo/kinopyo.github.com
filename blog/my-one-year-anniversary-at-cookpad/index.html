	<div class="entry-content"><h2>My &#8220;Thank You&#8221; Mails</h2>

<p>Yesterday was my one year anniversary at Cookpad, and I came up with an idea to send a couple of mails to my friends inside and outside the company, who have helped me to join it, just want to say thanks to them in person.</p>

<p>I wrote in the order of the people I&#8217;ve met. First starts with my headhunter who introduced cookpad to me, then my first and second interviewer, etc. I didn&#8217;t write to everyone I&#8217;ve met in the company, that will be too overwhelming and lose the point.</p>

<p>It ended up with 13 mails, since yesterday was Saturday and I sent to our company email address, I didn&#8217;t expect any replies until next business day. But surprisingly someone already replied and seems like they love this idea, and many positive feedbacks!</p>

<h2>WOW your friends</h2>

<p>Since one of my purpose is to WOW(a verb I learned from the book: Delivering Happiness) those my friends so to be honest, if everything works fine, and it should, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised by these positive feedbacks. But still, after reading their sweet words, it made me feel very very happy.I&#8217;m so glad that I made it. In my daily life I never feel lack of ideas to WOW someone but I never really execute in actions.</p>

<p>When I was reading the book, one story is about how Tony enjoyed organising a party and make a WOW experience to his friends. At that time I didn&#8217;t quite understand why he thought that way, but now I think I get it. It&#8217;s really a very amazing experience. It also reminded me that back in the days when I setup or prepared a surprise for my girlfriend, no need to go expensive or fancy, just something that a little bit weird and out of the box, then I will see the most beautiful smile in the world. This is a mindset and life style which I&#8217;ve decided to follow up. To make this world a better place, first step is to ensure you make your family and friends around you happier, right?</p>

<p>So this is my way to say thank you to my friends, some of the mails maybe even contain less than 10 phrases but it&#8217;s important to do it, and say it loud.</p>

<h2>Reconnecting, A Really Unrelated Story</h2>

<p>Oh, one more thing need to be mentioned. Yesterday I also got a message from my Senpai(先輩, Japanese, like one&#8217;s mentor) which I lost his contact 3 years ago. Every time when I reconnect with someone through Internet, I really appreciate what a good job it has done to make our life better. He was my first Senpai when I graduated and step into the whole adult society, even at that time he seemed really strict to me, it turns out it was worthwhile and I&#8217;d learned a lot from him. Not like how to write down each code, but in a much higher “Macro” point of view how to work, how to think. Sometimes I&#8217;m very surprised by this Japanese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senpai_and_k%C5%8Dhai">Senpai and kōhai</a> connection. This is really a word you have to self experience in Japanese society.</p>
