  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>When I was reading book this afternoon, not directly related to the its content but somehow it inspired me to realize some of self improvements I&#8217;ve accomplished through past couple of months or the past year. Most of them were changed subconsciously, like a good &#8220;by-product&#8221; thing.</p>

<h2>Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Taking stairs(mentioned before)</li>
<li>No more junk food, do more cooking</li>
<li>Sleep earlier, resist to temptation</li>
<li>Reading more often(thanks to Kindle Paperwhite)</li>
<li>No games at all(I&#8217;d like to have some)</li>
</ul>


<h2>No More Junk Food</h2>

<p>I can&#8217;t remember the last time I grabbed a burger at McDonalds. Maybe for you it doesn&#8217;t sound like a big deal, but for me it&#8217;s totally a different story.</p>

<p>When I was still a poor student in China, having a McDonalds burger is like a &#8220;highs in the month&#8221; event. It was quite expensive compared to the salary, or the pin money I could get from my dad. Plus it was, and still is so so delicious, way better than Japan. So at that time, my image of an ideal life was I can at least afford to have McDonalds every day.</p>

<p>Then after graduated from university, I came to Japan to work as a full-time software engineer. My salary was good enough to have    as many burgers as I want. Even though I knew people call it junk food, but for me it was not. I could eat McDonalds for one week straight.</p>

<p>I enjoyed it, I was happy. It seemed like that this was one thing impossible to change, not to mention I was not willing to change at all.</p>

<p>But what really changed me was after I joined cookpad, my current company. The company&#8217;s goal is to make cooking more fun, make people healthier. So more or less I got the point of why processed food is bad, then one day my boss sent me a link to <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_oliver.html">Jamie Oliver&#8217;s talk in TED</a>. That 20 minutes talk was amazing. Then I searched him in Youtube about his &#8220;Food Revolution&#8221;, and I watched all of them. That thing really changed my mind.</p>

<p>So from that moment, I started to review my pst, I found myself willing to change the habit of eating junk food.</p>

<h2>Do More Cooking</h2>

<p>But change is never easy. Even though I wanted to do more cooking, work fatigue, working overtime and a failed relationship made me feel extremely drained, exhausted and frustrated. Every time I got home I felt so powerless that I&#8217;d rather just skip the dinner. Shopping ingredients, looking for a simple enough newbie  friendly recipe and cook it felt so unreal.</p>

<p>But thanks to some good books I&#8217;ve read, I adjusted my attitudes toward work and relationships, I managed to keep myself stay positive and made some changes in working environment. Now I go home earlier than before, rarely any overtime, I&#8217;m still a little tired after  I open the door but I get the energy to go shopping and cook. Even though my cooking skill is not good, I can only cook several recipes and sometimes the taste is awful, I enjoyed it, I&#8217;m happy to serve myself, understand more about foods, balance diet nutritions from various ingredients, try out some new recipes in the weekend, etc. I feel content.</p>

<p>And what amazed me is that this change was much easier than I expected, especially judging from my past diet habit and &#8220;dreams&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t track my activities and mark them on a calendar. More like happened subconsciously, so, congret to myself! (But I&#8217;m still uncomfortable to cook with someones else cuz I&#8217;m clumsy and slow in the kitchen >_&lt;)</p>

<h2>A Must Watch Video</h2>

<p>OK I&#8217;ll stop here today but I want to share a very touching video with you. I&#8217;m 100% sure it&#8217;s worth watching so don&#8217;t miss it! You won&#8217;t regret! No spoiler here~</p>
