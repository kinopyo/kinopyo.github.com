<h2>Communication</h2>

<blockquote><p>Tests give you about the code. This happens over time, where you find that tests have become hard to write, the tests are becoming complicated and bogged down.</p>

<p>Rather than use it as an opportunity to blame the test or to blame testing, <strong>you should use it as an opportunity to learn something about your code, that there is a dependency that could potentially be simplified, or something you could be doing better.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h2>Keep relevant setup close</h2>

<blockquote><p>This is something that &#8220;relative good&#8221;(in terms of &#8220;absolute good&#8221;). It&#8217;s generally good to keep the setup of your tests close to the tests where it is.</p>

<p>What you want to avoid is the case where some sort of <code>before</code> setup way at the top of the file and you have stuff, and more stuff, and more stuff, and eventually in the end, what&#8217;s the <code>@user.name</code>? I don&#8217;t remember.</p></blockquote>

<h3>An Example</h3>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is where you see sometimes people say &#8220;You should never have setup outside your original test&#8221;.</p>

<h3>What to do about duplications and complicate shared setups</h3>

<blockquote><p>I think a lot of times if you need a complicated setup to test code, that often means your code is too complicated you need to start working out to move your dependencies. <strong>I tend to have a higher tolerance for duplication in my tests</strong> than I do in my regular code, specifically because <strong>I&#8217;m more interested in having the communication close</strong>, and less interested in maybe being clever about extracting setups in my tests. Sometimes I do if there&#8217;s a piece of stuff that&#8217;s really tightly coupled, and I can give it a descriptive enough name that I still feel like I have the benefit of keeping the setup close in the actual test.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Test Simple Values</h2>

<p>By using literal in check, when the spec fails, the error message is much easier to understand.</p>

<h2>Spy, don&#8217;t mock</h2>

<h2>What Do We Love?</h2>

<p>These are quite frank and interesting questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Do we still love writing tests?</li>
<li>Or do we just love having written tests?</li>
<li>Or do we just love saying that we&#8217;ve written tests?</li>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/notes-on-fast-test-slow-test/">Notes on Fast Test, Slow Test</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Recently I got lots of inspirations and thoughts on how to write good tests. Thanks to Cookpad, the company I’m working on, I get the chance to work on a very large scale rails app. But it also introduces me to some very bad tests. Sometimes I found myself so difficult to add any spec, as it needs lots of extra efforts to make the fixture data, also one model got too many dependencies and collaborators, etc. I know it’s wrong, the code smells, just don’t know where to start.</p>

<p>So when I watched this video “Fast Test, Slow Test” by <a href="https://twitter.com/garybernhardt">@garybernhardt</a>, who also runs <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts">DestroyAllSoftware screencast</a>, I found it very helpful and wanted to take some notes on it.</p>

<h1>Three Goals in Testing</h1>

<ul>
<li>Prevent Regression</li>
<li>Prevent Fear</li>
<li>Prevent Bad Design</li>
</ul>


<h1>How to Fail in Testing</h1>

<ul>
<li>Selenium as primary testing</li>
<li>“Units Test” are too large</li>
<li>Fine-grained tests around legacy code</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>What you’re saying here is that we acknowledge that this code sucks, so we’re going to go in and write tight tests around it that solidifies interface and just bake the badness forever. <strong>This is the worst way to do unit testing, go in your legacy system and write test around bad code.</strong></p></blockquote>

<h1>Too many dependencies in test</h1>

<blockquote><p>You end up with a test suite where it tends to either completely succeed or completely fail. It doesn’t give you any fine-grained feedback about what has actually gone wrong it just tells you you broke something. And you are left to dig these stack traces. <strong>In the ideal test suite you don’t have to dig through stack traces because ideally once test fails it will tell you exactly was broken (of course you never achieve that)</strong></p></blockquote>

<h1>More than 8 lines for a model test</h1>

<blockquote><p>I would ask myself why do I need to setup so much of the world to test this one small piece of behavior. That causes me to decompose it which causes better system design.</p></blockquote>

<h1>10% System/Acceptance Test, 90% Unit Test</h1>

<p>(in terms of test cases, not lines of code)</p>

<blockquote><p>That applies to mostly object heavy system like web app, that have a lot of logic and not a lot of boundaries.</p></blockquote>

<h1>Advice on models that very tied to database</h1>

<h2>Question</h2>

<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re working with model objects that they&#8217;re very tied to the database specifically things like you have to save that one object before you can associate with the other object and that means hitting the database. What&#8217;s your advice in terms of writing fast unit test?</p></blockquote>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<blockquote><p>Take all of that behavior that&#8217;s on your model objects and pull out of their into service classes that are stateless, that interact with the model objects. So view calls a service, service contains the intelligence and the service manipulates the model objects.</p>

<p>You can still have methods on your model objects do things like wrap specific queries in class methods, or wrap specific mutations when multiple fields are commonly manipulated together.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s okay to have those on your model object and then have the service use those but if you pull the behavior of the system out into the service, and you control the boundary between the service in the model by those methods you&#8217;ve written on the model, then you can mock out more easily and safely.</p></blockquote>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<div class='embed tweet'><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="ja"><p>Can&#8217;t believe that I watched the 3.5 hours long keynote video of Google I/O 2013 <a href="https://t.co/mBj3E6pB4q" title="https://developers.google.com/events/io/">developers.google.com/events/io/</a></p>&mdash; kinopyoさん (@fantasyday) <a href="https://twitter.com/fantasyday/status/335721881887989760">2013年5月18日</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div>


<p>Yesterday I was trying to catch up with the Google I/O 2013 to see what’s new. After I read some wrap up articles like <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2013/05/15/everything-announced-at-the-google-io-2013-keynote-in-one-handy-list/">Everything announced at the Google I/O 2013 keynote in one handy list - The Next Web</a>, I was very intrigued and ended up watching the whole 3.5 hours long keynote video.</p>

<p>Given that I’m not an Android user or developer, I still felt the improvements on Android system quite impressive. But my biggest inspriation is not on any specific topic, it’s how Google thinks of solving problem in the terms of technolodgy, not just web or mobile, they always think in a big picture. Much bigger than I do.</p>

<p>I’ve been a web developer for over 5 years and now I do feel I’ve got a handy toolkit to solve some problems. But I also feel I’ve constrained myself to this area, limited my imagination. Anything that can’t solve with the skills I’ve got is impossible. Web is bigger than I perceived, and yet it is just a part of technolodgy. We all know that it’s just a tool to solve problems, not the only way to do it.</p>

<p>I need to think out of the box. It’s too comfortable to just sit there and see their innovations, instead of trying to be the guy on the stage to amaze people with your innovations. I’ve spent less and less time on predicting the future of the technolodgy, but more and more on reality issues, like where to live, when to get married or so. I guess that’s the inevitable trend as you getting old but at least I shouldn’t let what I’ve learned blind myself. Keep looking, don’t settle.</p>

<p>I’d like to end this post with the quote of Steve Jobs.</p>

	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/when-to-buy-a-new-ipad-iphone-or-macbook/">When to Buy a New iPad, iPhone or Macbook</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I gave my iPad to my mom when I went back to China during the golden week, so I&#8217;m wondering if now is a good timing to buy a new iPad? Are they going to release a new model soon? &#8220;Buy or wait&#8221;, that&#8217;s the only options for me every time when I think about any product of Apple.</p>

<h2>Macrumors Buyers Guide</h2>

<p>Then I found this <a href="http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/">buyersguide</a> by Macrumors. I know Macrumors website for a long time and used to subscribe to their RSS feeds, but I never noticed they have a this website.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.kinopyo.com/images/macrumors_buyers_guide.png" alt="Macrumors Buyers Guide" /></p>

<p>Here you can see each Apple model with red or yellow round buttons. I guess there&#8217;ll be green ones once the &#8220;timing&#8221; is right to buy that product. As it says:</p>

<blockquote><p>provide our best recommendations regarding current product cycles, and to provide a summary of currently available rumors for each model. This page is based on rumors and speculation and we provide no guarantee to its accuracy.</p></blockquote>

<h2>When to Buy a New iPad</h2>

<p>If you click the iPad link you&#8217;ll see this:</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.kinopyo.com/images/when_to_buy_a_new_ipad.png" alt="When to Buy a New iPad" /></p>

<p>You can see the last release was October 23, 2012. Average
release cycles is 311 days so statistically there are still around 100 days left, but judging from the recent releases it could be next month! Recent rumors might be helpful, to at least give you something to fill in the blankness of waiting.</p>

<p>Maybe this time I&#8217;ll give iPad mini a try.</p>

<p><strong>2005</strong>. I was still in college. The phone I had was just a &#8220;pure&#8221; phone to call and text people, and even didn&#8217;t have a camera.</p>

<p><strong>2013</strong>. Now I have Macbook, iPhone, iPad, Kindle, all &#8220;rich&#8221; devices. With 3G network I can connect to Internet anytime anywhere. Life&#8217;s been changed so much.</p>

<p>I never had a Samsung GALAXY phone, but after watched this video I was surprised by some of the new features. I&#8217;ve been using iPhone for 3 or 4 years, I&#8217;m so used to it and sometimes it makes me blind to see other innovations.</p>

<p>The video is 4:30 long, please take a look when you have time.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>As you see below, this was how my blog header looks like before I write this post. There was no differece between top page(or home page, landing page) and the post page. If put into rails term, these are the <code>#index</code> and <code>#show</code> page, they&#8217;re sharing the exactly same header partial.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.kinopyo.com/images/my_blog_header.png" alt="old blog header" class="image_with_border"></p>

<h2>Thinking About My Target</h2>

<p>Based on the data from Google Analytics, around 85% of the access are from search engines like Google or Yahoo, so for them the contents I provided should be most important.</p>

<p>But for the direct access to the top page, they could be my friends, could be the headhunters, my future boss or colleague, or just some random strangers, anyway these people are my target who I really want to pay more attentions to, make them impressive, show a little  different things from the other audience.</p>

<h2>A Good Example</h2>

<p>Ryan Singer from 37signals, one day I happened to visit <a href="http://feltpresence.com/">his blog</a>, the moment I saw the page I knew this is one thing I also want to have in my blog!</p>

<p>Let’s take a look.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.kinopyo.com/images/ryan_singer_blog_show.png" alt="Rayn Singer’s blog, post page" class="image_with_border"></p>

<p>As you can see, the header in top page and every post page is different. Yes it’s low techy techy, easy to implement, not challenging at all, but it still matters.</p>

<h2>Time for Action!</h2>

<p>I’m sure every web developer understand this and every product they built must have a more beatiful and well designed landing page to catch people’s eyes. But do you apply the same principle to your own blog? You may use Wordpress or Octopress or any other blog generate tools to build your blog, and perhaps you even made a good <strong>About me</strong> page, but did you take one more step further to care about this detail? If you were aware of this and chose not to do it, it’s perfectly fine but to me, I don&#8217;t like to miss this detail.</p>

<p>Anyway here is my new blog header, just a simple introduction, I may add some more info later.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.kinopyo.com/images/new_blog_header_for_top_page.png" alt="New blog header for top page" class="image_with_border"></p>

<p>I guess this post may be nonsense to some of you. <strong>But if this is one thing that represent myself, at least I&#8217;d like to put more efforts to make it a little more “me”.</strong></p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img src="http://cdn.kinopyo.com/images/sleepy_on_the_train.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>最近はよく8時間寝ても朝電車に乗るとまた眠くなっちゃうんですよ。なぜなのかな？自分の精神力が弱い？それとも科学的に説明できる一般的な現象？というのを少し調べたのでここで簡単にまとめたいと思います。</p>

<h2>ゆりかご</h2>

<p><img src="http://cdn.kinopyo.com/images/yurikago.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>ネットでは結構な回答がありますが、やはり<strong>ゆりかご</strong>というのが原因らしいです。</p>

<blockquote><p>単発の振動は脳には刺激を与えますが、周期的な振動は脳が慣れてしまうのでゆりかごに近い状態になるんですね</p></blockquote>

<p>　</p>

<blockquote><p>電車の中で眠くなる、というのは普通です。よく、赤ちゃんを寝かしつけるときなんかに背中を一定のリズムでトントン叩いてあげますね。あの「一定のリズムでくる刺激」というのは、人間だけでなく胎生哺乳類全般に眠りを呼び起こすもののようです（うちの猫も、眠そうにしてるときに背中をトントン叩くといっぺんに寝ちゃいます）。
これはわたしの推測ですが、母親の胎内にいたときに聞いていた、母親の心臓の鼓動に似たリズムが安心感を呼び起こし、眠くなるんじゃないでしょうか。
同じ意味で、むずがる赤ちゃんにＴＶの砂嵐の音を聞かせるといっぺんに静かになる、というのがあります（これは胎内で聞いていた母親の血流音と、砂嵐の音が似ているためだそうです）。</p></blockquote>

<p>これが一番論理的な説明かな。</p>

<blockquote><p>体は乗り物の振動に合わせて揺れ、それを追いかけるようにして内臓も揺れます。この二つの揺れ方の波が奇跡的に一致する振動が、電車のあのガタンゴトンなのだそうです。体と内臓は、コップとその中の水とお考えください。</p>

<p>たとえば落下するジェットコースターだと、体だけ先に落ちてしまい内臓が取り残されて吐き気がしますし、悪路の自動車だと震度が小刻みすぎて、体と内臓が別々にシェイクされてしまい、不快になる。ところが電車だと、車両と体と内臓の三者が一体となって動くのだそうです。揺れているのに不快ではない、最高の揺りかごです。</p></blockquote>

<p>本当にこれだけで人間は眠くなるものなのか。。？</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>If you browse amazon reviews chances are you already saw this <strong>Amazon Verified Purchase</strong> label. This is not a new feature, I think it&#8217;s been there for a while but I just want to point that out.</p>

<p><img src="http://cdn.kinopyo.com/images/amazon_verified_purchase.png" alt="Amazon Verified Purchase" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to understand, it means the reviewer purchased that item at Amazon, could highly increase the credibility of the review.</p>

<p>I think it&#8217;s easy to implement, the logic is simple but it&#8217;s a good indicator for users to decide if they should follow or trust the review.</p>

<p>Also I tried it myself. When I click to write a review for the book I bought on Amazon, I get this option to choose if I&#8217;d like to label myself as purchased the item.</p>

    <article class="post">
	<h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/being-aware-of-self-improvements/">Being Aware of Self Improvements</a></h1>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>When I was reading book this afternoon, not directly related to the its content but somehow it inspired me to realize some of self improvements I&#8217;ve accomplished through past couple of months or the past year. Most of them were changed subconsciously, like a good &#8220;by-product&#8221; thing.</p>

<h2>Improvements</h2>

<ul>
<li>Taking stairs(mentioned before)</li>
<li>No more junk food, do more cooking</li>
<li>Sleep earlier, resist to temptation</li>
<li>Reading more often(thanks to Kindle Paperwhite)</li>
<li>No games at all(I&#8217;d like to have some)</li>
</ul>


<h2>No More Junk Food</h2>

<p>I can&#8217;t remember the last time I grabbed a burger at McDonalds. Maybe for you it doesn&#8217;t sound like a big deal, but for me it&#8217;s totally a different story.</p>

<p>When I was still a poor student in China, having a McDonalds burger is like a &#8220;highs in the month&#8221; event. It was quite expensive compared to the salary, or the pin money I could get from my dad. Plus it was, and still is so so delicious, way better than Japan. So at that time, my image of an ideal life was I can at least afford to have McDonalds every day.</p>

<p>Then after graduated from university, I came to Japan to work as a full-time software engineer. My salary was good enough to have    as many burgers as I want. Even though I knew people call it junk food, but for me it was not. I could eat McDonalds for one week straight.</p>

<p>I enjoyed it, I was happy. It seemed like that this was one thing impossible to change, not to mention I was not willing to change at all.</p>

<p>But what really changed me was after I joined cookpad, my current company. The company&#8217;s goal is to make cooking more fun, make people healthier. So more or less I got the point of why processed food is bad, then one day my boss sent me a link to <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/jamie_oliver.html">Jamie Oliver&#8217;s talk in TED</a>. That 20 minutes talk was amazing. Then I searched him in Youtube about his &#8220;Food Revolution&#8221;, and I watched all of them. That thing really changed my mind.</p>

<p>So from that moment, I started to review my pst, I found myself willing to change the habit of eating junk food.</p>

<h2>Do More Cooking</h2>

<p>But change is never easy. Even though I wanted to do more cooking, work fatigue, working overtime and a failed relationship made me feel extremely drained, exhausted and frustrated. Every time I got home I felt so powerless that I&#8217;d rather just skip the dinner. Shopping ingredients, looking for a simple enough newbie  friendly recipe and cook it felt so unreal.</p>

<p>But thanks to some good books I&#8217;ve read, I adjusted my attitudes toward work and relationships, I managed to keep myself stay positive and made some changes in working environment. Now I go home earlier than before, rarely any overtime, I&#8217;m still a little tired after  I open the door but I get the energy to go shopping and cook. Even though my cooking skill is not good, I can only cook several recipes and sometimes the taste is awful, I enjoyed it, I&#8217;m happy to serve myself, understand more about foods, balance diet nutritions from various ingredients, try out some new recipes in the weekend, etc. I feel content.</p>

<p>And what amazed me is that this change was much easier than I expected, especially judging from my past diet habit and &#8220;dreams&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t track my activities and mark them on a calendar. More like happened subconsciously, so, congret to myself! (But I&#8217;m still uncomfortable to cook with someones else cuz I&#8217;m clumsy and slow in the kitchen >_&lt;)</p>

<h2>A Must Watch Video</h2>

<p>OK I&#8217;ll stop here today but I want to share a very touching video with you. I&#8217;m 100% sure it&#8217;s worth watching so don&#8217;t miss it! You won&#8217;t regret! No spoiler here~</p>
